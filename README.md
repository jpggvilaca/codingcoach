# Coding coach assignments for mentees

## Purpose of the repo
I'm currently mentoring a few people on [Coding Coach](https://codingcoach.io/).
I created this repo to gather a few assignments for the mentees to work on.

## How it works
I will provide all the requirements and technical info on the README of each
assignment.

You should:
* Create a board on https://trello.com/ and invite me (through private message 
on slack/skype). This will help you stay organized and will allow me to see how
you organise yourself and divide tasks.
* Fork this repo
* Go to the project folder and work on it (Do not add files to the root folder where this README is)
* Instructions for the assignment will be on the README inside the assignments's folder.

*NOTES*
* You will NOT push to this repo, you will work on your forked repository.
* DO NOT push to your repo directly
* You should create a new branch and then open a *PULL REQUEST* to merge your branch into your `master` branch.
* After that you should send me the url so I can review it. This will allow me to help you on every commit. You can also add me as a contributor so I can freely merge/block PR's.

## Instructions unclear?
Please send me a message on skype/slack so I can update the README.
